General

Simarrange is a program that simulates collisions between STL meshes in 2D in order to generate tightly packed sets of parts.
It takes a directory of STL files as input and outputs STL files with combined plates of parts.
The parts are assumed to be in the correct printable orientation already.

Usage

./sa

This will convert the STLs in the directory "test" into plates using the default options, and emit these plates and thumbnails of them into the current directory.

The program understands the following options:

-x 
x dimension of build plate in mm, default 200, must be a positive integer
-y 
y dimension of build plate in mm, default 200, must be a positive integer
-s
Minimal spacing between parts, in mm, default 1, must be a positive integer
-r
rotational granularity of search space in degrees, default 10 (reduce for tighter, slower packing)
-p
positional granularity of search space in mm, default 5 (reduce for tighter, slower packing)
-i
input directory, default "test"

Examples

./sa -x 200 -y 150 -i input

Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x150mm

./sa -s 10 -i input

Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x200mm with 10mm spacing between parts

./sa -x60 -y60 -s3 -i blah -p 2

Convert all files from the directory "blah" into plates of size 60x60mm with 3mm spacing between parts and 2mm search grid

Compiling

simarrange depends on the following libraries:

admesh (included in source)
utlist (included in source)
argtable2
opencv (libcv, libcxcore, libhighgui)

You can install the dependencies in a debian/ubuntu system with the following command:

sudo apt-get install libhighgui-dev libcv-dev libargtable2-dev

A build script called build.sh is included in the package. Run it to compile the program.
