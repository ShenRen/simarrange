General

Simarrange is a program that simulates collisions between STL meshes in 2D in order to generate tightly packed sets of parts.
It takes a directory of STL files as input and outputs STL files with combined plates of parts.
The parts are assumed to be in the correct printable orientation already.

Usage

./sa test

This will convert the STLs in the directory "test" into plates using the default options, and emit these plates and thumbnails of them into the current directory.

The program understands the following options:

-x --width
x dimension of build plate in mm, default 200, must be a positive integer
-y --height
y dimension of build plate in mm, default 200, must be a positive integer
-c --circle
build plate is circular, with diameter given by -x
-s --spacing
Minimal spacing between parts, in mm, default 1, must be a positive integer
-r --rotstep
rotational granularity of search space in degrees, default 10 (reduce for tighter, slower packing)
-p --posstep
positional granularity of search space in mm, default 5 (reduce for tighter, slower packing)
-o --outputdir
output directory, default "."
-d --dryrun
only do a dry run, computing placement but not producing any output file


Examples

./sa -x 200 -y 150 -o output input

Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x150mm and save to directory "output", creating it if necessary

./sa -x 179 -c input

Convert all files from the directory "input" into circular plates of 170mm diameter and save to directory "output", creating it if necessary

./sa -s 10 input

Convert all files from the directory "input" into plates of size 200x200mm with 10mm spacing between parts

./sa -x60 -y60 -s3 blah -p 2

Convert all files from the directory "blah" into plates of size 60x60mm with 3mm spacing between parts and 2mm search grid

./sa file1.stl file1.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl

Place two copies of file1.stl and four copies of file2.stl into plates of size 200x200mm

./sa input file1.stl file1.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl file2.stl

Place all STL files in the directory "input" as well as two copies of file1.stl and four copies of file2.stl into plates of size 200x200mm


Compiling

simarrange depends on the following libraries:

admesh (included in source)
utlist (included in source)
argtable2
opencv (libcv, libcxcore, libhighgui)

You can install the dependencies in a debian/ubuntu system with the following command:

sudo apt-get install libhighgui-dev libcv-dev libargtable2-dev

A build script called build.sh is included in the package. Run it to compile the program.


Compiling on Mac OS

First, you will need to install Homebrew. Once you've done that, run

brew tap homebrew/science
brew install argtable
brew install opencv

and then run the build.sh script included with simarrange to compile the program.
